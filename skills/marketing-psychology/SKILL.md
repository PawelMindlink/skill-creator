# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

This skill applies deep psychological triggers to marketing. We split psychology into two layers: **The Offer (Macro)** and **The Attention (Micro)**.

# 1. The Macro Driver: Hormozi's Value Equation

Users do not buy "products". They buy a **Dream Outcome**. To maximize value, we must hack this equation:

$$Value = \frac{Dream\ Outcome \times Perceived\ Likelihood}{Time\ Delay \times Effort\ \&\ Sacrifice}$$

* **Dream Outcome (Increase)**: What is the "Heaven" state? (e.g., "Making $10k/mo" not "Buying a course").
* **Perceived Likelihood (Increase)**: Do they believe *they* can do it?
  * *Lever*: Social Proof, Guarantees, "Legal" language (e.g., "Swears under oath").
* **Time Delay (Decrease)**: How fast do they get the result?
  * *Lever*: "In 9 weeks", "Instant access".
* **Effort & Sacrifice (Decrease)**: The strongest lever.
  * *Lever*: "Without cardio", "Done-for-you", "Cheatsheet".

# 2. The Micro Fuel: Curiosity & Dopamine

If Value is the destination, **Dopamine is the fuel** that moves them through the "Greased Chute".

* **Purpose**: Overcome constraints/friction at every micro-step (Scroll -> Stop -> Expand Text -> Read -> Click).
* **Mechanism**: The Curiosity Gap (Information Gap Theory).
  * *Context*: "I found a secret..."
  * *Gap*: "...that changes everything about X."
  * *Resolution*: [Must Click to Find Out].

## The "Ozempic Paradox" (Synthesis)

The most powerful ads combine these two:

* **Offer**: "Lose 12kg (Dream) without cardio (Low Effort) in 9 weeks (Low Time)." **(High Value)**.
* **Hook**: "The weird 'Purple Fizzy Juice' ritual usually kept secret..." **(High Curiosity Fuel)**.

# Key Frameworks

## 1. Inversion (Via Negativa)

Often we define things by what they are *not*.

* "Get [Dream Outcome] **WITHOUT** [Effort/Sacrifice]."
* This directly attacks the denominator of the Value Equation.

## 2. Cialdini’s 6 Principles

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value -> Get attention.
2. **Social Proof**: Numbers, Reviews (Boosts *Perceived Likelihood*).
3. **Authority**: Expert endorsement (Boosts *Perceived Likelihood*).
4. **Consistency**: Micro-commitments.
5. **Liking**: Authenticity/Rapport.
6. **Scarcity**: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).

# How to Audit

Audit any asset by asking:

1. **Value Check**: Did we lower the denominator? (Did we remove Effort/Time?)
2. **Fuel Check**: Is there enough Curiosity to get them to the next line?
3. **Scent Match**: Does the Landing Page deliver the *exact* Dream Outcome promised in the Ad?

## Troubleshooting

* **Weak Hook**: If the "fuel" is low, the ad won't get past the scroll. Use Inversion to attack a specific "Effort & Sacrifice" point.
* **Complex Offer**: If the Dream Outcome is too broad, Perceived Likelihood drops. Make it more specific.
* **High Friction**: If users engage but don't convert, check for hidden costs in the denominator (e.g., long loading times or complicated checkout).
