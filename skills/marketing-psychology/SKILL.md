# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

This skill applies deep psychological triggers to marketing. The core driver of all online behavior is **DOPAMINE**.

# The Core Driver: Dopamine

Dopamine is not just "pleasure". It is **Desire** and **Information Seeking**. We can trigger it in two distinct (and sometimes opposite) ways to ensure MECE coverage:

1. **The Curiosity Drive (Uncertainty)**:
    * *Mechanism*: "I need to know the answer to close this mental gap."
    * *Use Case*: Top of Funnel, high-noise environments, "Bored" scrollers.
    * *Tactics*: Blind hooks ("What he found..."), Shock, Novelty.
2. **The Specificity Drive (Certainty/Relief)**:
    * *Mechanism*: "I have a specific pain and this looks like the specific cure."
    * *Use Case*: High-pain markets (Health, B2B), Intent-based search.
    * *Tactics*: "Lose 12kg in 9 weeks", "Fix knee pain in 5 minutes".

# Key Frameworks

## 1. The Curiosity Gap (Lowenstein)

The space between *what we know* and *what we want to know*.

* **Rule**: Provide enough context to make them care, but withhold enough to make them click.
* *Too vague*: "Amazing trick." (Ignore)
* *Too specific*: "Drink water to lose weight." (I know the answer, no click).
* *Perfect*: "The 5-minute morning liquid ritual that burns fat." (I need to know *which* liquid).

## 2. Inversion (Via Negativa)

Often we define things by what they are *not*.

* "Get [Benefit] **WITHOUT** [Common Pain/Effort]."
* This removes friction and objection simultaneously.

## 3. Cialdini’s 6 Principles (The Classics)

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value -> Get attention.
2. **Social Proof**: "1067 niches", "7.8 Billion generated". Numbers build trust.
3. **Authority**: "Scientific studies show...", "As seen on TV".
4. **Consistency**: Micro-commitments (Click -> Read -> Buy).
5. **Liking**: Authenticity, "Raw Native" content builds rapport.
6. **Scarcity**: "Page comes down soon", "Only 5 spots".

# How to Audit

Audit any asset by asking:

1. **Is the Dopamine Trigger clear?** Is it Curiosity or Specific Relief? (If neither, it fails).
2. **Is there a Gap?** Does the headline force me to read the body?
3. **Is the Cost < Reward?** Is the text easy to read (Greased Chute) relative to the value promised?
