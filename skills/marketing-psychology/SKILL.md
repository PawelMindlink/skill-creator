# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

This skill applies fundamental psychological principles and mental models to marketing materials to increase influence and conversion.

## When to use this skill

- When reviewing copy or strategy for persuasiveness.
- To identify missing psychological triggers in a campaign.
- To apply specific frameworks (e.g., Cialdini's Principles, Fogg Behavior Model).
- To debug why an ad or page isn't converting.

## Core Models

### 1. The 6 Principles of Persuasion (Cialdini)

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value before asking.
2. **Commitment/Consistency**: Small yes leads to big yes.
3. **Social Proof**: "Others are doing it."
4. **Authority**: Expert endorsement.
5. **Liking**: We buy from humans we like.
6. **Scarcity**: Fear of missing out (FOMO).

### 2. Behavioral Economics

- **Loss Aversion**: Pain of losing > Pleasure of gaining.
- **Anchoring**: The first number mentioned sets the baseline.
- **Paradox of Choice**: Too many options kill conversion.
- **Decoy Effect**: A "bad" option makes the target option look better.

### 3. Pricing Psychology

- **Charm Pricing**: 9.99 vs 10.00.
- **Price Relativity**: Offering Good/Better/Best tiers.

## How to use

1. **Audit**: Analyze the input (copy, landing page, offer) against the Core Models.
2. **Identify Gaps**: "This offer lacks Scarcity" or "There is no Social Proof."
3. **Suggest Fixes**: "Add a countdown timer" or "Include a testimonial near the CTA."
