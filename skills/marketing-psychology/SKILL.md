# Marketing Psychology & Mental Models

This skill applies deep psychological triggers to marketing. The core driver of all online behavior is **DOPAMINE**.

# The Core Driver: Dopamine

Dopamine is the molecule of *more*. It drives seeking. We trigger it via two primary **Levers**. While distinct, they often work best when combined (The "Ozempic Paradox": A Guaranteed Result via a Secret Mechanism).

## Lever 1: The Curiosity Drive (Uncertainty)

* **Mechanism**: "I gap in my knowledge that I must close."
* **Feeling**: Itch, Intrigue.
* **Best For**: Stopping the scroll (Pattern Interrupt).
* **Example**: "What he found on this USB..." (Pure Curiosity).

## Lever 2: The Specificity Drive (Certainty/Relief)

* **Mechanism**: "I have a specific pain and this is the specific cure."
* **Feeling**: Hope, Relief, Validation.
* **Best For**: Closing the sale (Action).
* **Example**: "Lose 12kg in 9 weeks." (Pure Specificity).

## The Synthesis (Hyperdopamine)

The most powerful ads often use **Curiosity to Hook** and **Specificity to Convert**.

* *Structure*: [Wonder/Shock] -> [Mechanism] -> [Specific Result].
* *Example*: "The weird 'Purple Fizzy Juice' **(Curiosity)** that melts 12kg in 4 weeks **(Specificity)**."

# Key Frameworks

## 1. The Curiosity Gap (Lowenstein)

The space between *what we know* and *what we want to know*.

* **Rule**: Provide enough context to make them care, but withhold enough to make them click.

## 2. Inversion (Via Negativa)

Often we define things by what they are *not*.

* "Get [Benefit] **WITHOUT** [Common Pain/Effort]."
* This removes friction and objection simultaneously.

## 3. Cialdini’s 6 Principles

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value -> Get attention.
2. **Social Proof**: Numbers, Reviews (Safety in herd).
3. **Authority**: Expert endorsement (Safety in rank).
4. **Consistency**: Micro-commitments.
5. **Liking**: Authenticity/Rapport.
6. **Scarcity**: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).

# How to Audit

Audit any asset by asking:

1. **Which Lever is pulling?** Is it "Mystery" or "Relief"? If neither, it's boring.
2. **Is the mix right?**
    * *High Pain Market (e.g., Acute Back Pain)*: Needs more **Certainty** ("Fix it now").
    * *Low Pain/Bored Market (e.g., Gadgets)*: Needs more **Curiosity** ("Look at this cool thing").
3. **Is the Cost < Reward?** Is the text easy to read relative to the value promised?
