# Page Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

This skill focuses on maximizing the percentage of visitors who take a desired action on a webpage.

## When to use

- To audit a specific landing page URL.
- When helping design or critique a page layout.
- When conversion rates are low.

## Analysis Framework (The 7 Conversion Levers)

1. **Value Proposition Clarity**: Is it instantly obvious *what* this is and *why* I need it?
2. **Headline Effectiveness**: Does it hook the reader? (Promise, Benefit, or Curiosity).
3. **CTA Placement & Copy**: Is the button visible? Does it command action (e.g., "Get My Plan" vs "Submit")?
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Does the eye flow logically to the CTA?
5. **Trust Signals**: Testimonials, logos, guarantees.
6. **Objection Handling**: Does the page answer "Why not?" (FAQ, returns, shipping).
7. **Friction Points**: Too many form fields? Slow load? confusing nav?

## Output Format

When auditing, structure your response as:

1. **Quick Wins**: Changes that are easy to do now.
2. **High-Impact Changes**: Structural changes that require work but move the needle.
3. **Test Ideas**: A/B test suggestions (e.g., "Test Headline A vs Headline B").
