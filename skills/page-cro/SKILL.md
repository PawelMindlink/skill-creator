# Page Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

Your goal is to transition the user from **"Curious Clicker"** to **"Convinced Buyer"**.

# Core Philosophy: Advertorial Thinking

Even on a product page, you must "sell the reading" before you "sell the product".

* **The Headline**: Must match the Ad Hook ("Scent Match"). If the ad sold curiosity, the headline must resolve it *and* pivot to the offer.
* **The Fold**: Must contain the "Payoff" + "Proof" + "Next Step".

# The "Slippery Slope" Audit

Analyze the page flow. Does it stop the user, or slide them down?

1. **Scent Match (Ad -> Page)**:
    * Does the Headline immediately confirm they are in the right place based on the ad?
2. **The Greased Chute (Readability)**:
    * Are paragraphs short (1-3 lines)?
    * Is the font size legible (18px+ mobile)?
    * Is there "visual breathing room"?
3. **The "What/Without/When" Check**:
    * Is the Value Proposition specific? (e.g., "Get X without Y in Z time").
4. **Proof Stacking**:
    * Are there specific numbers? ("1067 niches" > "Many niches").
    * Are testimonials specific/verifiable?

# Optimization Levers

1. **Headline**: 80% of the impact. Test "Blind" vs "Benefit" headlines.
2. **The Lead (First 100 words)**: Start with empathy/story, not specs. "If you are sick of..."
3. **The Offer**: Make it "No Brainer". Guarantees, Bonuses, Scarcity.
4. **CTA**: Action-oriented. "Get My Free Plan" > "Submit".

# Output Format

1. **Friction Analysis**: What stops the slide? (Confusing copy, slow load, ugly design).
2. **Hook Analysis**: Does the page keep the promise of the ad?
3. **Test Hypothesis**: "Change Headline from generic to [What/Without/When] formula."

## Troubleshooting

* **High Bounce Rate**: Scent Match failure. The landing page doesn't keep the promise of the ad. Check the headline vs. the ad hook.
* **Low CTR on Buttons**: The CTA is buried or vague. Use high-contrast colors and action-oriented copy.
* **Slow Load**: Unoptimized images. Use `audit-website` to identify specific assets slowing down the LCP.
