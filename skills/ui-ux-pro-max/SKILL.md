# UI/UX Pro Max

This skill provides professional-grade UI/UX design intelligence, understanding that **Context is King**.

# Contexts: Product vs. Marketing

## 1. Product & App Design (The "Clean" Mode)

* **Goal**: Usability, Trust, Retention, Accessibility.
* **Aesthetic**: Consistent, polished, minimal noise, WCAG compliant.
* **System**: 8px grid, consistent typography, predictable patterns.
* **When to use**: Dashboard, Settings, SaaS Tools, Banking Apps.

## 2. Marketing & Ad Design (The "Conversion" Mode)

* **Goal**: **ATTENTION**, Click-Through, Sale.
* **Aesthetic**: "Dopamine Design". High contrast, bold typography, "Native" feel.
* **The "Ugly" Truth**: Sometimes big, yellow, highlighted text works better than a subtle grotesque sans-serif.
* **Native UI Mimicry**: Elements that look like system notifications (iOS bubbles, toggle switches) often convert better because they feel familiar.

# Priority Checklist

1. **Clarity (Above All)**: Can the user understand the offer in 3 seconds?
2. **Visual Hierarchy**:
    * **Primary**: The Hook / Headline.
    * **Secondary**: The CTA / Benefit.
    * **Tertiary**: The details.
3. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for interactions (fingers are fat).
4. **Load Time**: Fancy animations that load slowly kill conversion (LCP < 2.5s).

# How to use

* **Critique (Product)**: "Analyze this dashboard for usability friction and consistency."
* **Critique (Marketing)**: "Analyze this LP. Is the CTA obvious? Is the 'Fold' utilized? Is it too 'pretty' and boring?"
* **Generate**: "Design a 'News Ticker' component for a landing page header to induce urgency."

## Troubleshooting

* **Accessibility Issues**: Check color contrast if text is hard to read. Marketing design often sacrifices this—find a balance.
* **Over-design**: If a interface is too "pretty," it might be boring and lose attention. Add "Ugly Truth" elements or Native UI mimicry.
* **Conversion Friction**: Check LCP and touch targets on mobile if engaged users aren't clicking.
